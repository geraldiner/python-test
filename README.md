# Python Test
I started to learn more Python to figure out how to handle my Magical Movies project.

tldr; I want to take the list of magical movies as suggested by Redditors, watch them, and see how 'magical' they actually turn out to be.

I went through a VS Code tutorial to set up a Python environment in VS Code, which included writing a 'Hello, World!' and sine plot.

Then I extended what I'd previously learned to process initial information via [Pushshift](https://pushshift.io). With Pushshift, I was able to get the IDs for every comment on the thread I was interested in, and get the information about those comments, and save them in a `txt` file. However, I don't think it's in any form for me to do any real processing for finding the actual movie titles.

This led me to try out a [textual analysis tutorial](https://github.com/geraldiner/textual-analysis) to see if it might be something for my project
